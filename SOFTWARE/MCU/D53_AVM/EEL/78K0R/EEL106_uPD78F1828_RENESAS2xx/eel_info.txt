How to integrate:
=================

1) copy all the files into your project subdirectory

2) add all eel*.* files into your project (workbench or make-file)
   Attention: For C-Compiler project (eel_descriptor.c/eel_descriptor.h/eel_user_types.c)
              For Assembler  project (eel_descriptor.asm/eel_descriptor.inc)

3) add the FDL library into your project and configure the pool

4) adapt project specific files as follows:

   a) eel_descriptor.h/eel_descriptor.inc:
      - set library storage type, number of variables and threshold
      NOTE: In case the number of variables is changed descriptor in
            eel_descriptor.c/eel_descriptor.asm must be adapted.
   b) eel_user_types.h/eel_descriptor.asm
      - configure the size of each user variable
   c) eel_descriptor.c/eel_descriptor.asm
      - in case of changed number of variables adapt the descriptor due to new/deleted variables

5) adapt the *.dr file due to your requirements
   --> at least segments EEL_CODE, EEL_CNST, EEL_DATA, EEL_SDAT and EEL_UDAT should be defined

6) re-compile the project
