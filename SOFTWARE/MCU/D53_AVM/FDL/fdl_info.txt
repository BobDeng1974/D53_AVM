How to integrate:
=================

1) copy all the files into your project subdirectory

2) add all fdl*.* files into your project (workbench or make-file)
   Attention: For C-Compiler project (fdl_descriptor.c/fdl_descriptor.h)
              For Assembler  project (fdl_descriptor.asm/fdl_descriptor.inc)

3) adapt project specific files as follows:

   a) fdl_descriptor.h/fdl_descriptor.inc:
      - adapt the pool configuration (please refer to the users manual for detailed description)

4) adapt the *.dr file due to your requirements
   --> at least segments FAL_CODE and FAL_CNST should be defined

5) re-compile the project
